<h1>DOGECOIN CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICE PREDICTION USING LSTM</h1>

__AIM__

Creating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to forecast Dogecoin's price is the project's goal. The objective is to create a trustworthy predictive model that can predict future changes in Dogecoin prices by utilizing machine learning techniques and historical price data.

**DATASET DESCRIPTION**

The project makes use of Dogecoin historical price data that was collected from different cryptocurrency exchanges. The dataset which is used to train and assess the LSTM model, includes Dogecoin's daily closing prices during a specified time period.

__METHODOLOGY__Â 

a) Data Preprocessing: In order to prepare the raw data for LSTM input, it is normalized and sequenced.

b) Model Development: The Keras library is used to build an LSTM neural network architecture. To identify trends and connections in the price time series, the model is trained using the preprocessed data.

c) Model Evaluation: To gauge the performance of the trained model, it is assessed on a different test set. To measure how accurate the predictions are, metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are computed.

d) Visualization: To give a clear comparison and insight into the model's performance, the anticipated and real Dogecoin prices are displayed side by side.

**RESULTS**

When it comes to predicting the price of the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, the LSTM model shows encouraging results. The following are some important conclusions:

a) Accuracy Metrics: On the test dataset, the model obtains an RMSE of 0.2615 and an MAE of 0.1859.

b) Visualization: The model's ability to visualize the overall trends and patterns in the Dogecoin price data is demonstrated by the comparison of anticipated and 
   actual prices.
   
c) Further Evaluation: Additional analysis can shed more light on the advantages and disadvantages of the model. Examples include residual analysis and comparison 
   with baseline models.

**CONCLUSION**

The Dogecoin Cryptocurrency Price Prediction experiment shows how well LSTM neural networks function for predicting Dogecoin prices. Through the use of machine learning algorithms and historical price data, the model offers traders, investors, and cryptocurrency fans insightful information. More in-depth and trustworthy price prediction models may result from ongoing study and development in this field, which will advance knowledge of and analysis of cryptocurrency markets.
