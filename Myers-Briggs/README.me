The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI), a test created by CPP, Inc., uses four pairs from Carl Jung's theory of psychological types to assess a respondent's preferences for how they see the world and make decisions.It was developed with the intention of making Jung's theory applicable and understandable in people's daily lives by Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers. The goal of the test is to determine respondents' preference in response patterns, which can subsequently be categorized into one of 16 personality types.
